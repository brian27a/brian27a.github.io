			<h2> What this website is about </h2>    	
				<ul>
			<li> I'm learning to code and this is my first website ever.</li> 
			<li> It will get better over time. </li>
			<li> I'm patient with myself :D </li>   
			</ul>
				<p> I will publish content about the finnish language with some references to topics I'm interested in. Hopefully this content will also be of interest to you! </p>

			<h3> What this website is <b> not </b> about </h3> 
			<p> This is an experiment. It is not meant to satisfy any audience-facing educational standards and thus it may contain mistakes (this is how I learn!). </p>
