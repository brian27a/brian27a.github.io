    <p> This is a website coded by a non-finnish enthusiast who loves the finnish language and its culture, including the Linux operating system and its creator! </p>
    <h1> What this website is about. </h1>
    <p> I'm learning to code and this is my first website ever. It will get better with time. I'm patient with myself :D <br/>
      I will publish content about the finnish language with some references to topics I'm interested in. Hopefully this content will also be of interest to you! </p>
