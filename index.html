    <h1> What this website is about </h1>
    <ul>
    	<li> I'm learning to code and this is my first website ever.</li> 
    	<li> It will get better over time. </li>
    	<li> I'm patient with myself :D </li>   
    </ul>
  <p> I will publish content about the finnish language with some references to topics I'm interested in. Hopefully this content will also be of interest to you! </p>
    <h2> What this website is <b> not </b> about </h2> 
    <p> This is an experiment. It is not meant to satisfy any educational standards for an audience and thus it may contain mistakes (this is how I learn!). </p>
