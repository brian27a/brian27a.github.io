    <p> This is a website coded by a non-finnish enthusiast who loves the finnish language and culture, including the Linux operating system and its creator! </p>
    <h1> What this website is about. </h1>
    <p> I'm learning to code and this is my first website ever. It will get better with time. I'm patient with myself :D <br/>
      I will publish content about the finnish language with some references to topics I'm interested in. Hopefully this content will also be of interest to you! </p>
    <h2> What this website is <b> not </b> about. </h2> 
    <p> This is an experiment. It is not meant to satisfy any educational standards for an audience and thus it may contain mistakes (this is how I learn!). </p>
